# sharing_files


This repository we can use to share files among each other before the R workshop.


**To upload a new file**

1. Start by clicking on the "upload file" button.

2. Select file to upload

3. Before the file gets saved you need to commit at bottom of the page. Do this by writing a very short description of the file (a few words) and press the "commit" button. To keep it simple use the default "Commit directly to the master branch." option.
